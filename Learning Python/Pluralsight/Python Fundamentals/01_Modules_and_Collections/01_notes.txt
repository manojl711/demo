single inheritance > multiple inheritance > virtual inheritance

REPL > Read Evaluate Print Loop (IDLE)

print() is a function call in python3 hence the braces

Indentation
Imagine code/lines replaced with grey lines.
We should be able to see the structure/indentation of the code
We should see the levels of code indented

4 white spaces = standard indentation
Dont mix spaces and tabs

PEP 8 tells how to write python code (guidelines)

Python standard libraries is also called as Batteries Included (aka Modules)

'.' operator is used to drill down into object structures

help(math) or help(math.factorial)

nan - not a number
inf - infinite
-inf - negative infinity

null = None

A function that doesnt returns any value, returns None

with statements - avoids resource leaks
It calls urlopen() function and binds the response to a variable named story
